######
# Given two datasets containing dessert and ingredient information,
# your task is to write a function or code snippet to match each
# dessert with the most suitable ingredient based on the similarity
# of their embedding values. Each dessert and ingredient has an
# associated embedding value represented as a NumPy array.
