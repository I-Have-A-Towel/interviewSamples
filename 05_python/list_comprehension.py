# Step 1: Create a list comprehension that generates the squares of the numbers from 0 to 9.




# Step 2: Use a conditional expression in the list comprehension to only include the squares of even numbers.




# Step 3: Add a nested list comprehension to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number and its square.




# Step 4: Use the zip function to combine the list of even numbers and the list of even squares into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number and its square.




# Step 5: Use the zip function to combine a list of even numbers and the list of even squares into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number and its square.
